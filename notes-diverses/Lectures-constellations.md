“Design Software is an open issue because part of a designer’s work is to choose and question their tools.”

“Before the era of industrialization and the separation of people and the means of production, craftsmen were creating their own tools. They were extremely ingenious in adapting their tools to one’s hand size and handedness, or to achieve particular effects”

“Experienced designers know that off-the-shelf, general software tools obscure the potential of software as a medium for expression and communication. Writing custom, unique tools with software opens new potentials for creative authorship”(Reas, C. & McWilliams, C. (2012). Progammer avec Erik van Blokland, Catalogtree, Amanda Cox, Nicholas Felton, FIELD, LUST, Boris Müller, onformative, Jonathan Puckey, Sosolimited & Trafik, Graphisme en France, code<>outils<>design. Centre National d'Art Plastique.). 

“everyone designs who devises courses of action aimed at changing existing situations into preferred ones.”
―Herbert Simon in The Sciences of the Artificial, p.130

“Graphical Substrates can be turned into interactive objects that represent and mediate relationships among graphical elements. These reified relationships can scaffold and evolve during designers’ exploration phase.”

### Design Software - creator perspectives

“According to Suchman (Suchman, 2007), “Every human tool relies on, and materializes, some underlying conception of the activity that it is designed to support”. ”
“Studying the intention behind software can help us understand the hidden assumptions that often go unquestioned. ”


It has turned out that the properties of a computer drawing are entirely different from a paper drawing not only because of the accuracy, ease of drawing, and speed of erasing provided by the computer, but also primarily because the ability to move drawing parts around on a computer drawing without the need to erase them. Had a working system not been developed, our thinking would have been too strongly influenced by a lifetime of drawing on paper to discover many of the useful services that the computer can provide (Sutherland, 1963)
